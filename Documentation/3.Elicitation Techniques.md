  **Justification:** Helps admins understand user trends and priorities, enabling informed decisions for platform policies and feature design.

- **Discourse Analysis (forums, reviews of existing apps):**  
  Analyze recurring themes in user complaints (e.g., fake listings, poor filters).  
  **Justification:** Identifies common issues faced by users, allowing the admin team to prioritize fixes and improve system reliability.

- **Prototyping:**  
  Validate how users search, filter, and compare properties.  
  **Justification:** Ensures that admin interfaces and workflows support efficient monitoring, reporting, and decision-making before full-scale development.

- **Use Cases & Scenarios:**  
  Model actions like verifying property proofs, approving listers, handling user complaints, and monitoring suspicious activity.  
  **Justification:** Clearly defines admin responsibilities and edge cases (e.g., what happens if a property proof is invalid), reducing ambiguity in requirements.

- **Brainstorming:**  
  Encourage internal discussion among admins (and with legal/developers when needed) to generate strategies for fraud prevention and policy enforcement.  
  **Justification:** Allows the admin team to collaboratively consider fraud scenarios and dispute handling strategies. Combined perspectives create stronger fraud detection policies and smoother coordination with Legal and Developers.

- **Risk Analysis:**  
  Identify potential threats like fraudulent listings, fake listers, or data misuse.  
  **Justification:** Critical because admins directly handle compliance and fraud issues. Risk analysis ensures preventive measures are designed into the system, improving security and reliability.

## 3.1 Legal Team

**Techniques:**
- **Analysis of Existing Systems / Documentation:**  
  Review property registration laws, land records, compliance policies, and real estate regulations.  
  **Justification:** The legal framework is already established. The team refers to existing laws and policies (e.g., RERA guidelines, government APIs for land records) rather than creating new rules.

- **Questionnaires / Interviews:**  
  Clarify from legal experts what documents are mandatory for property proof, acceptable formats, and legal limitations.  
  **Justification:** Efficiently collects structured input from busy legal professionals, ensuring the system captures all legal requirements without wasting time.

- **Use Cases & Scenarios:**  
  Define system behavior in different legal situations, such as incomplete proof submission, fraudulent registration IDs, or disputes.  
  **Justification:** Translates legal requirements into actionable system behavior. For example, if a property registration ID fails verification, the system flags it for admin review instead of approving it automatically.

---

## 3.2 Government / Regulatory Body

**Techniques:**
- **Automated verification through APIs:**  
  System checks property ID against government database → reduces manual work.

- **Analysis of Existing Systems / Documentation:**  
  Study property registration processes, land records, RERA guidelines, and available public APIs.  
  **Justification:** Government procedures and compliance laws are well-documented. The system must adapt to them, not reinvent them.

- **Interviews / Questionnaires:**  
  Collect structured requirements from government officials or compliance experts (e.g., mandatory data fields for property verification).  
  **Justification:** Ensures the system aligns with legal and regulatory requirements.

- **Use Cases & Scenarios:**  
  Define interactions with government databases, including verifying registration IDs, handling invalid entries, or API unavailability.  
  **Justification:** Bridges the gap between legal processes and technical implementation (e.g., marking flagged listings as pending verification and notifying admins).
