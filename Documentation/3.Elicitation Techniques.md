# ELICITATION TECHNIQUES

## 1. Visitor

**Techniques:**
- **Questionnaires:** 
  Collect feedback from potential visitors about what information they expect without logging in.  
  **Justification:** Since visitors don’t directly interact with developers, surveys offer a simple and scalable way to capture their expectations (e.g., property details, location visibility) without needing detailed interviews.

## 2.1 Lister / Seller / Owner / Real Estate Agent

**Techniques:**
- **Analysis of Existing Systems:**  
  Observed established real estate platforms (e.g., MagicBricks, 99acres, Zillow).  
  **Justification:** Ensures system includes essential features (like filters) and stays realistic by aligning with industry standards and best practices.  

- **Use Cases & Scenarios:**  
  Model lister actions such as adding a property, updating details, deactivating listings, and responding to buyers.  
  **Justification:** Modeling lister actions such as adding a property, updating details, and deactivating listings helps capture interactions between the lister and the system. This technique ensures that functional requirements are not missed.  

- **Brainstorming (within the project group):**  
  Discuss potential requirements as a team, drawing from each member’s ideas, observations, and prior knowledge of real estate platforms.  
  **Justification:** Since stakeholders weren’t present, group brainstorming helped in generating diverse ideas quickly (e.g., property comparison, admin approval flow). It also allows the group to identify potential requirements.

## 2.2 Buyer / Renter

**Techniques:**
- **Questionnaires / Surveys (via Google Form):**  
  Collect preferences from a wide range of buyers/renters about filters (budget, location, property type, reviews).  
  **Justification:** Buyers/renters form the largest and most diverse user group. Surveys provide broad, quantifiable data (e.g., what percentage of people care most about locality vs. cost) efficiently.  

- **Use Cases & Scenarios:**  
  Model buyer’s actions such as search with filter, compare property etc.  
  **Justification:** Modeling buyer actions such as searching, filtering, saving, and comparing properties helps capture interactions between the buyer and the system. This technique ensures that functional requirements are not missed.

## 3. Admin

**Techniques:**
- **Discourse Analysis (reviews of existing apps):**  
  Analyze recurring themes in user complaints (e.g., fake listings, poor filters).  
  **Justification:** Identifies common issues faced by users, allowing the admin team to prioritize fixes and improve system reliability.  

- **Use Cases & Scenarios:**  
  Model actions like approving listers, handling user complaints, and monitoring suspicious activity.  
  **Justification:** Clearly defines admin responsibilities and edge cases (e.g., what happens if duplicate property listings are detected), reducing ambiguity in requirements.  

- **Brainstorming (within the project group):**  
  Conduct internal discussions among project group members to generate ideas for fraud prevention, policy enforcement, and system management strategies.  
  **Justification:** Even without real admins, group brainstorming helps the team explore possible fraud scenarios, dispute handling workflows, and policy rules. It ensures multiple perspectives are considered, leading to stronger, more comprehensive system requirements.  

- **Risk Analysis:**  
  Identify potential threats like fraudulent listings, fake listers, or data misuse.  
  **Justification:** Critical because admins directly handle compliance and fraud issues. Risk analysis ensures preventive measures are designed into the system, improving security and reliability.

## 3.1 Technical Team

**Techniques:**
- **Brainstorming (within the project group):**  
  Conduct internal discussions among project group members to identify potential security risks and strategies for prevention.  
  **Justification:** Group brainstorming allows the team to anticipate vulnerabilities, consider possible attack scenarios, and design preventive measures for user data and sensitive property proofs without direct access to real security staff.

## 3.2 Customer Support Team

**Techniques:**
- **Discourse Analysis:**  
  Analyze emails and call records to identify recurring problems.  
  **Justification:** Guides system improvements by highlighting common issues, such as confusion in understanding pricing details, ensuring smoother user experience and better support.  

- **Brainstorming (within the project group):**  
  Discuss solutions to improve dispute resolution workflows and user assistance features.  
  **Justification:** Group brainstorming enables the project team to generate practical and innovative ideas for optimizing user support, including potential enhancements such as automation (e.g., chatbots).  ted system behavior, avoids miscommunication, and establishes testable requirements.
