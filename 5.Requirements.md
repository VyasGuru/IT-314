# Real Estate Listing Website – Requirements Specification

---

## Elicitation Techniques Used

### Questionnaires / Surveys
We collected feedback from a large number of potential users using online forms and surveys. This helped us understand what features people really want and how they expect the website to work.

**Justification:** It shows what most users care about, like saving favorite properties or comparing prices, and helps us prioritize the features that will be most useful.

### Brainstorming
We held open discussions with team members to come up with as many ideas as possible for the website. Everyone could contribute freely without worrying about whether an idea was perfect.

**Justification:** This approach helps discover creative features and solutions that we might not think of otherwise and gives us a pool of ideas to refine into real requirements.

### Use Cases & Scenarios
We mapped out typical actions of different users, like adding a property, saving listings, or requesting a visit, step by step. We also considered what could go wrong, like a document being expired or a request being rejected.

**Justification:** This makes sure we don’t miss important details and helps define how the system should behave in all situations, not just the ideal ones.

### Analysis of Existing Systems
We studied popular real estate websites like Bayut and 99acres to see how they work and what features they offer. This helped us understand what users expect and what is standard in the industry.

**Justification:** By looking at existing platforms, we can include essential features, avoid mistakes, and make our system practical and competitive.
