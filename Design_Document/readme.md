# Design Diagrams

This folder contains all the design diagrams for the project. These diagrams help visualize the system architecture, workflow, interactions, and state transitions within the application.

## Included Diagrams

- **Class Diagram**  
  Represents the structure of the system by showing classes, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between them.

- **Activity Diagram**  
  Illustrates the flow of activities and actions within the system, showing how processes progress from start to finish.

- **Sequence Diagram**  
  Describes how objects interact with each other over time, emphasizing the order of messages exchanged during a specific process.

- **State Diagram**  
  Shows the various states an object or system can be in, and how it transitions between states based on events.

## Diagram Creation Details

### Activity, Class, and State Diagrams (Draw.io)
The **activity**, **class**, and **state** diagrams were created manually using **draw.io**, following **UML / UML 2.5** standards.  
Both the **.drawio** source file and the exported **JPG** images are included in this folder.

To verify or edit these diagrams in draw.io:

1. Import or open the `.drawio` file using the draw.io web editor or desktop application.
2. The diagrams can be found on the following pages within the file:
   - **Page 1:** Class Diagram  
   - **Page 2:** Activity Diagram  
   - **Page 3:** State Diagram  

### Sequence Diagram (PlantUML)
Due to its length and complexity, the **sequence diagram** was created using **PlantUML** rather than draw.io.

The **PlantUML source code file** is included in this folder.  
To generate or view the diagram:

1. Copy or open the provided PlantUML code in any **PlantUML editor** (online or desktop).
2. The editor will automatically render the sequence diagram from the code.

All diagrams are included to support the understanding, development, documentation, and maintenance of the project.
